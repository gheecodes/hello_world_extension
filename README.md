"# hello_world_extension" 
Hello there, 

These are the steps to run the Google Chrome Hello World Extension below:
Clone the folder,
Open chrome://extensions/,
Enable "Developer mode" by clicking the toggle switch in the top right corner.
Click the load unpacked button, it will open file explorer,
While on file explorer, click on local disk and click on users folder,
While on that page, you will click on the folder that is originally named customers(which is your name),
Then locate the folder and click on it, click on details which is labeled on the extension,
Select pin to toolbar,
And voila the extension is set for you to input as many information you want to input.

Thank you for checking my little project out.
